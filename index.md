## Research Associate in Space Plasma Physics at Imperial College

I research the plasma environment in the local interplanetary medium with satellites. Highlights of my research include writing sophisticated codes and software to obtain information from satellites, calibrate the data, and produce scientific data products. Most modern outstanding physics problems require synergy between small teams of which I take on a leadership role.
