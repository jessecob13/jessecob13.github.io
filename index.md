## Background

I completed my bachelor's degree of science in physics with honors at the University of New Hampshire in 2013. After a short gap year, I think became a graduate research assistant at the University of Calabria in Italy. Next, I moved to London where I completed my doctoral degree in astronomy at Queen Mary University in 2022. During the period of my doctoral degree I was a graduate research assistant at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for two summers. Next, I began a postdoctoral position in space plasma physics at University College London. In early 2025, I began a second postdoctoral degree (called a research associate) at Imperial College, where I currently operate my research agenda.

## Research overview

Title: Research Associate in Space Plasma Physics at Imperial College

I research the plasma environment in the local interplanetary medium with satellites. Highlights of my research include writing sophisticated codes and software to obtain information from satellites, calibrate the data, and produce scientific data products. Most modern outstanding physics problems require synergy between small teams of which I take on a leadership role.
