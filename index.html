<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>
I research the plasma environment in the interplanetary medium with satellites (often called spacecraft). Highlights of my research include writing sophisticated codes and software to obtain information from satellites, calibrate the data, and produce scientific data products. Most modern outstanding physics problems require synergy between small teams of researchers, I take on leadership roles and command thorough and cutting-edge scientific researsh.

<h2 id="background">Education Background</h2>
<p>
For a formal conscription of my background please access my <a href="CV_Coburn.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a>. I completed my bachelor's degree of science in physics with honors at the University of New Hampshire in 2013. After a short gap year, I became a graduate research assistant at the University of Calabria in Italy. Next, I moved to London where I completed my doctoral degree in astronomy at Queen Mary University in 2022.
<p>
My doctoral <a href="thesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a> was on compressible plasma waves in the solar wind plasma. In weakly collisional plasmas the particle mean free path is shortened by wave-particle interactions. This has drastic implications on the equation of state and thermodynamics of the solar wind plasma. My thesis work serves as the first measurements of the shortened effective mean free path. I provided a newly calibrated datasets with observations by the Wind spacecraft and a novel linear dispersion relation solver with arbitrary mean free path.
<p>
For my doctoral thesis I won the Keith Runcorn Thesis Prize in 2023, which is awarded by the Royal Astronomical Society.
<p>
During the period of my doctoral degree I was a graduate research assistant at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for two summers. During this time I worked with simulations of collisonless plasmas to test a novel method to obtain infromation on particle dsitribution functions and calcualte particle heating and acceleration due to wave-particle interactions. I published this work here: XX.
<p>
Next, I began a postdoctoral position in space plasma physics at University College London. In early 2025, I began a second postdoctoral (called a research associate) position at Imperial College, where I currently operate my research agenda.
